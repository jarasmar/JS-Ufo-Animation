## Dev Progress

Project built in **2.5 days** with no prior experience in Javascript canvas drawing and animations.

I started trying to build the app directly in React, but I have barely used React before so I ended up changing into a basic Javascript app to learn first how to make the drawings and the animations.

Once the project was already looking and working as I wanted it I tried migrating it into React again. I got the canvas component rendering all the background but run out of time before I managed to make the animations work with the intervals.

You can see the React app progress in this other repository: https://github.com/jarasmar/Ufo-Animation
